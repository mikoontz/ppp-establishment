# Introduction
We introduced 917 populations of *Tribolium* flour beetles comprising 20 individuals apiece to novel environments that were either stable or randomly fluctuating through time, varying the number of introduction events used to distribute them (1, 2, 4, or 5 events). Thus, there were 4 levels of "introduction regime" (20 individuals introduced in the 1st generation, 10 individuals introduced in the first 2 generations, 5 individuals introduced in the first 4 generations, and 4 individuals introduced in the first 5 generations), and 2 levels of "environmental stability" (stable or randomly fluctuating through time).

Our goal was to investigate how the introduction regime and environmental stability of the recipient environment might affect establishment probability and the population abundance of the established populations.

This repository (`mikoontz\ppp-establishment`) represents the data and analysis from the experiment.

# Files in Repository

## scripts
### data-carpentry
These scripts clean and fortify the data to make it ready for analyses.

#### generate-establishment-responses-for-analysis
File type: .R

Takes short form data and appends population attributes (e.g. treatments, notes, presence of introduction gap) as well as various response variables of interest (established/extinct for each fixed generation, established/extinct for each relative generation after introductions completed) for further analysis.

#### generate-tidy-data
File type: .R

Converts long form census data (one row represents the census for each population/generation combination) into short form (one row represents censuses for each population with different generations in different columns) for more intuitive access to data. 

### figure-carpentry
Scripts that generate the figures in the paper

#### experiment-time-series-population-abundance-plot
File type: .R

Script to generate the <a href="#experiment-time-series-population-abundance">experiment-time-series-population-abundance</a> figure.

#### experiment-time-series-establishment-proportion-plot
File type: .R

Generates the <a href="#experiment-time-series-establishment-proportion-absolute-time-type">experiment-time-series-establishment-proportion-absolute-time-type</a> and <a href="#experiment-time-series-establishment-proportion-relative-time-type.tif">experiment-time-series-establishment-proportion-relative-time-type</a> figures.

#### establishment-and-abundance-experiment-and-simulation-results-plot
File type: .R

Generates the <a href="#establishment-probability-experiment-and-simulations.tif">establishment-probability-experiment-and-simulations.tif</a> and <a href="#population-abundance-experiment-and-simulations.tif">population-abundance-experiment-and-simulations.tif</a> figures.

### simulations
Scripts related to the simulation component to the project.

#### NBBg-population-dynamics-function
File type: .R

Simulates N<sub>t+1</sub> given N<sub>t</sub> and the values of 4 key parameters of the NBBg model (R<sub>0</sub>, $\alpha$, kE, and kD).

#### NBBg-simulation-functions
File type: .R

Helper functions to setting up the simulation of the NBBg model using estimated parameter values (and their distributions) from a separate fitted model.

#### NBBg-simulation-script
File type: .R

Script runs the simulation functions and summarizes output.

### environmental-stochasticity
File type: .R

Calculates total stochasticity through time using lambda values for each population that remained extant throughout entire experiment. Uses a linear mixed effects model to assess the effect of environmental treatment (stable or fluctuating) on this total stochasticity value. We'd expect our fluctuating treatment to impose more variation in lambda values.

### establishment-probability
File type: .R

Mixed effects logistic regression analyses with establishment as response (1 or 0) with introduction regime and environmental stability as covariates. The script includes several analyses, all with a check to see whether the introduction gap in generation F2 was important. 

Assessments of establishment or extinction were made at fixed time points throughout the experiment (generations F5, F6, F7, F8, and F9), at a relative time point (5 generations after the final introduction event for each introduction regime), and at each time point with the population ID as a random effect in a repeated measures framework.

### population-abundance
File type: .R

Mixed effects Poisson regression analyses with population abundance as response with introduction regime and environmental stability as covariates.The script includes several analyses, all with a check to see whether the introduction gap in generation F2 was important. 

Assessments of population size were made at fixed time points throughout the experiment (generations F5, F6, F7, F8, and F9) and at a relative time point (5 generations after the final introduction event for each introduction regime).

### temporary-extinctions
File type: .R

Assessment of whether temporary extinctions in the multiply-introduced populations affected establishment probability or population size. Tests effect of temporary extinction versus no temporary extinction (categorical variable with 2 levels) as well as effect of "amount of loss" (continuous variable) representing how many of the 20 possible individuals introduced did not have a genetic contribution to the population when response was assessed. That is, the "amount of loss" represents how much of a bottleneck the population passed through during introduction.

### NBBg-NIMBLE
File type: .R

Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to estimate parameters in NBBg model from Melbourne and Hastings (2008) using the `nimble` package.

### NBBg-script
File type: .R

Script to run `nimble` algorithm, assess MCMC diagnostics, and write samples to a file for use in simulations.

### NBBg-script-validation
File type: .R

Test of the NBBg `nimble` code on simulated dataset with known parameters and on a published dataset with previously estimated parameters (Melbourne and Hastings, 2008).

### NBBg-environment-stability-effect
File type: .R

Uses the NBBg `nimble` code to estimate parameters of the NBBg model fit to the raw experimental data from Generation P to Generation F1 in the fluctuating environment versus the stable environment. We would expect the kE parameter to be larger in the stable environment, indicating less variability in N<sub>t+1</sub> arising from environmental stochasticity.
